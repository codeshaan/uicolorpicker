JSX is a HTML like syntax used by React. It is just like
regular HTML except that there are some modifications. The syntax 
is intended to be used by preprocessors like Babel to transform HTML like text found in JavaScript files into standard JavaScript objects that a JavaScript engine will parse.

Basically, we can use JSX to write concise HTML like structures in the same file as we write JavaScript code, then Babel will transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code.

JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the UI should look like.


Basic JSX Usage.

const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;


Embedding expressions in JSX
We can put any valid JavaScript expressions inside the curly braces in JSX. The below example renders "Hello, foo" in the UI

const name = 'foo';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name} </h1>

Specifying Attributes in JSX
Attributes are little different in JSX unlike plain HTML. Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase naming convention inside of HTML attribute names
for ex -

 <div class="container"></div>
 <div className="container"></div>

 <div tabindex="0"></div>
 <div tabIndex="0"></div>


 Rendering JSX in React...
 const name = 'John Doe';
 const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>

 ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
